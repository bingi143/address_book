       '''
       Description: 
           The function initializes and configures a logger with both file and 
           console output. The logger is set to log messages at the DEBUG level 
           or higher, and includes a specific format for log messages. The logs 
           are saved in a file named 'all.log' and also displayed in the console.
       Parameters:
           name (str): The name of the logger, usually used to distinguish log 
           sources (e.g., module or class name).
       Return:
           logging.Logger: A configured logger instance that writes logs to both 
           a file and the console.
